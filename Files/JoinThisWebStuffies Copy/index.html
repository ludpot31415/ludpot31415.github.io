            <h1>No Más</h1>

            <p>The exit was located before his eyes, quite accessible, but he hesitated. He only abstained reasoned the severe consequences he would face upon leaving, some being unimaginable to the human mind. It was deemed one of the worst transgressions in the area, and as he did not wish to realize the penance on himself, he instead ventured back to his room, where he proceeded to finish the assignments he was given by his respective District Unit.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;He lived in District 8, presumed to be located in Siberia; well – at least rumored. It was difficult to gain knowledge regarding the  situation, but one could always theorize, and most of the research team had a pretty good idea. It was thought that a dozen intelligent scientists working in different fields, were handpicked, kidnapped and moved to research facilities located throughout the globe. All of them had fairly luxurious rooms, and every day through the hatch integrated in the door, they received a parcel containing consumables, assignments and other daily needed items such as toiletries. But the most bizarre event, was once a month when an envelope could be found in the box, in it being a paycheck of 20.000 Units – an unknown currency, but believed to be converted to the currency of your country of origin upon finishing your time in the district.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;District 8 was a large underground facility with hundreds of tunnels, rooms and areas. All walls were a light shade of grey, and everything seemed quite clean, this being because of the daily-deployed cleaning staff. Cameras could be seen in the corners of halls and passages, providing surveillance to the administration board, and every passage was equipped with a door requiring ID authorization to open. Redd, his name, had an ID card with a bright text saying “B2”, referring to his level of authorization, and under that being his title and initials. Once in a while masked soldiers could be seen walking the halls, these being the district units in charge of security and handing out assignments to the inhabitants of the facility. A few times a month you would be granted permission to leave your residential block and perform work in the research sector. The work mostly involved in testing psychoactive substances and bio or chemical weaponry on death row inmates, all in exchange for Units. The inmates all wore black jumpsuits, with their initials and the text C3 on their back, the latter referring to their authorization level, which of course meant they did not have access to any equipment or passages in the facility.</p>
